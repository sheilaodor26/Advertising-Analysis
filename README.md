# Advertising-Analysis
Samsung just launched a new marketing effort for its product (Galaxy S23 Ultra). The current advertising strategy (Ad1) has an existing mean sale of 55,000 units per week. In the attempt to enhance their marketing effectiveness and boost sales, Samsung has developed a new advertisement (Ad2) and has been collecting sales data over the past 20 weeks.

The primary purpose of the analysis is to ascertain whether or not the recent advertisements campaign (Ad2) has a major effect on increasing sales of the Galaxy S23 Ultra. The main comparison is between Ad2's average weekly sales and Ad1's predetermined mean of 55,000 units per week. By carrying out hypothesis testing, specifically a one-sample t-test, the goal of the analysis is to give statistical evidence that Ad2's average Sales grew dramatically as compared to the baseline of 55,000 units. This information will help Samsung assess the effectiveness of the new advertising strategy and make informed decisions about its future implementation.
In summary, the analysis serves as a tool for Samsung to gauge the success of their new ad campaign and determine whether it is achieving the desired outcome of increasing sales beyond the established baseline.

# HYPOTHESIS STATEMENT (USING THE ‘IF’ STATEMENT)
Dependent Variable – Weekly sales for the Galaxy S23 Ultra (Ad2)

Independent Variable - New advertisement (Ad2) 

If the mean weekly sales for Ad2 increases over 55,000 units over 20 weeks, then there is proof that the new advertising campaign has a beneficial impact on the average sales of the Galaxy S23 Ultra. That is, if the mean is more than 55,000 units/week, the new advertisement (Ad2) will have a major effect on increasing Galaxy S23 Ultra sales.

Ho: μ = null hypothesis - If the average sales for Ad2 do not increase, the mean sales for Ad2 are 55,000 units per week, and we reject the claim that they have increased.

Ha: μ > alternate hypothesis - If there is an increase in the average sales for Ad2, the mean sales for Ad2 are more than 55,000 units each week, and we fail to reject the claim of an increase..

The 'IF' statement emphasizes the condition under which we would conclude that Ad2 has a impact on the sales.

# A PROCEDURE OUTLINE DESCRIBING THE HYPOTHESIS STATEMENTS DEVELOPED

Step 1: State the Hypothesis Statement – It is always mandatory to write this statement.

The null hypothesis is the commonly accepted fact. A test used to test the validity that is made about the population. Here, Ad2's average weekly sales are 55,000 units or fewer.

The alternate hypothesis tries to demonstrate that the null hypothesis is incorrect. In this situation, Ad2's average weekly sales exceed 55,000 units.

Ho: μs = 55,000 units/week.

Ha: μs > 55,000 units/week.

μ represents the population mean of the sales for Ad2.

Step 2:  State how significant you want to be- This is a likelihood of making an incorrect decision when the null hypothesis is true.

The significance level = 0.05. It means that you are willing to accept a 5% chance of making a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis). A 5% significance level was chosen for this analysis because it provides a clear and commonly accepted criterion for decision-making in hypothesis testing.

Step 3: Performt a one-sample t-test 

To determine the average over the course of 20 weeks, we compute the Ad2 sales mean. Next, use a t-test to compare the Ad2 sales mean with the 55,000 unit predicted mean. This test is also known as Student’s T-distribution, is a statistical way of testing a hypothesis when the sigma is not known or the sample size is smaller than 30. That is, n<30.This test is sensitive to outliers as it may violate the assumptions of t-test. A one sample t-test will be used as we don’t know the population standard deviation.

Based on the alternative hypothesis (Ha: μs > 55,000), the test in this analysis is one-tailed. 

Since we are attempting to determine whether the average weekly sales for Ad2 are higher than 55,000 units, we are only interested in one direction of the distribution—in this example, the right tail. We would reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis if the observed test statistic is located in the extreme right tail of the distribution.

Step 4: Calculate the P-Value

P-value is the maximum risk that can be taken to reject the null hypothesis It will be useful in reaching a decision. If the p-value equals the specified level of significance (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that the observed data is statistically significant, and there is sufficient evidence to imply that average Ad2 sales have climbed significantly from the previously established mean of 55,000 units each week.

If the p-value exceeds 0.05, you cannot reject the null hypothesis. This shows that there is insufficient data to establish that Ad2's average sales have climbed much above 55,000 copies per week. 

P-value and significance level (α) should be compared. We reject the null hypothesis if p=α. Reject the null hypothesis if p exceeds α.

Step 5: Write a conclusion

If the p-value is equal to or greater than the significance level, we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.

If the p-value is small (less than 0.05), we can conclude that the new advertising campaign (Ad2) has a statistically significant impact on increasing sales for the Galaxy S23 Ultra. That is, the smaller the p-value, the more substantial the evidence.
