# Advertising-Analysis
Samsung just launched a new marketing effort for its product (Galaxy S23 Ultra). The current advertising strategy (Ad1) has an existing mean sale of 55,000 units per week. In the attempt to enhance their marketing effectiveness and boost sales, Samsung has developed a new advertisement (Ad2) and has been collecting sales data over the past 20 weeks.

The primary purpose of the analysis is to ascertain whether or not the recent advertisements campaign (Ad2) has a major effect on increasing sales of the Galaxy S23 Ultra. The main comparison is between Ad2's average weekly sales and Ad1's predetermined mean of 55,000 units per week. By carrying out hypothesis testing, specifically a one-sample t-test, the goal of the analysis is to give statistical evidence that Ad2's average Sales grew dramatically as compared to the baseline of 55,000 units. This information will help Samsung assess the effectiveness of the new advertising strategy and make informed decisions about its future implementation.
In summary, the analysis serves as a tool for Samsung to gauge the success of their new ad campaign and determine whether it is achieving the desired outcome of increasing sales beyond the established baseline.

# HYPOTHESIS STATEMENT (USING THE ‘IF’ STATEMENT)
Dependent Variable – Weekly sales for the Galaxy S23 Ultra (Ad2)

Independent Variable - New advertisement (Ad2) 

If the mean weekly sales for Ad2 increases over 55,000 units over 20 weeks, then there is proof that the new advertising campaign has a beneficial impact on the average sales of the Galaxy S23 Ultra. That is, if the mean is more than 55,000 units/week, the new advertisement (Ad2) will have a major effect on increasing Galaxy S23 Ultra sales.

Ho: μ = null hypothesis - If the average sales for Ad2 do not increase, the mean sales for Ad2 are 55,000 units per week, and we reject the claim that they have increased.

Ha: μ > alternate hypothesis - If there is an increase in the average sales for Ad2, the mean sales for Ad2 are more than 55,000 units each week, and we fail to reject the claim of an increase..

The 'IF' statement emphasizes the condition under which we would conclude that Ad2 has a impact on the sales.
